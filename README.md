PySpeedReader
=============

Spritz like speed reader made in python

because of hasty coding, you may only have one copy of speed-reader.py on your computer
in order for the program to work. Place a UTF-16 text doc in the same directory as speed-reader.py
Make this directory void of all other text docs. Run the program and press load. The text doc will
automatically be loaded into the program. For more information, read the ReadMe in the zip file.




This application is dependent on pyglet. 
If you are on a mac, install pyglet with pip install hg+https://pyglet.googlecode.com/hg/.

or run the program as a mac application by 
unziping the zip and open the .app file (extension hidden)
